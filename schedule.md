### Full standards covarage
_around 3 hours_
* some more stuff from C++14
* new things from C++17
* libraries and API design
* error handling
* maybe a bit more for advanced data structures...

## Week 6
_around 5 hours_
### System programming and multithreading

* from power ON to system starting (booting process)
* a little bit about architectures (CPU (insides, cores, instructions), busses, memory)
* brief discusion about OS-es:
  - kernel
  - what they do?
  - rings
  - processes
  - a bit \*NIX stuff
* shells
